## Fullstack Dotnet and RPA Developer

I am currently in my final year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Analysis and Systems Development at IFRR. Since 2018, I have been deeply immersed in Dotnet and automation technologies. My aspiration is to evolve into an exceptional solutions developer with the capability to tackle any technology or challenge. While I have a strong proficiency in C# and Dotnet, I also have prior experience working with Java. Additionally, I have undertaken some studies in Python, specifically for automation tasks, including RPA, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. I am also well-versed in JavaScript, both in Node.js and React.
